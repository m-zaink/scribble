# Sometimes. 
Sometimes, we meet those that fit perfectly with our little imperfections.
The imperfections we aren't proud of ourselves but they find a way to mold 
them into a golden crease like on an old china dish. 
They find our darker sides and shed an infinitude of luminosity on them. 
They lead us to those higher places where we coudln't have reached on our own.
Sometimes, you strain with them. It can be rosy forever you know.
But the strain, tension and frustration flies when the dust settles and you see
them for what they're. Angels sent from heaven for reasons you can't fathom.
And that someones are rare in our life and when you find them, give them wings.
