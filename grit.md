# Grit
    -m-zaink 
When life hits us hard.  
That monumental moment.  
All columns shred and all hopes falter.  
Ivory strength turns meek.  
And heart takes a slow pace.  
You draw a deep sigh, only to let it dwindle away.  
Your eyes droop and your soul sags.  
And then something comes along.  
A lone lantern in the dreary night.    
A humble angel in the perilous hell.    
It's your inner calling. Your dearthy grit. You commitment to make it big.  
Your mind takes a tiny jolt.  
And then starts a carburator.  
Like a old dusty car that creaks.  
And on it starts.  
With few chokes here and there.  
It coughs and stumble but walks ahead far away.  
And then it coughs a bit more until it doesn't anymore.  
It picks up speed.  It takes the roads with great might.  
It lurks right at it's hefty sight.  
On and on it goes.  
Right into its destiny.  
That which awaits him, albeit a smiling sage, knows of earlier tales.  
Awaits patiently.
