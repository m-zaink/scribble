# SHRIEK
    -m-zaink

Under war torn countries  
Little blossoms left life  
Earlier than they were meant to  
Crying mothers and helpless fathers  
Paraded publicly. Lost were women's rights  
Men were tortured  
All but for petty political heights  
They all aimed to bring order to the world  
Forgetting that they have lost order within  
No single belief could compensate for the losses  
What do you say when it all lead to same strife?  
Soaked in blood  
Civilians shrieked  
The whole world watched while they weeped  
Pseudo guards guarded it all wrong  
The fight was to rid themselves of crime  
And lo behold  
They lost their souls internally  
Immersed in the same deep dark destiny  
Not single death was justified  
All those who died  
Their curses remain upon us  
Us who saw it so mindlessly  
And did.  
Did nothing at all!
