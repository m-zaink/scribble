I'm going insane.
In this depth of disgust.
It's a rather lost cause, in the name of perfection.
I have against fought over.
Till I fought again.
And again..
Of this innane breach of insanity.

I fought forever..
Until I fought never again...
I held my breath..
Till I could...
I held it for too long..
Until I no more could...
I lost my breath..
In this insanity
I went down till I could..
I kept my gaze down...
I kept my eyes closed...
Until I no more could...
I burst and spill out like lava...
And then it sped wrought all away...

I held my breath.
Until I couldn't.
I held it all.
And then I marched away.
I broke down.
Tears tumbling away.
Choking under my sobs.
I held it away.
I can't take it anymore.
I wish I can end it all.
With the blink of my eyes.
Until I no more could make it away
I wish all this ends.
This pain.
I hope this stop not far away.

I shall see in my eyes.
And sob away.
I can't see that which isn't mine.
I stand brave.
Until I lose my sanity.
